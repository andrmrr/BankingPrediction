# BankingPrediction
This project conducts an analysis over a *Bank Marketing dataset*, which compiles call information from a Portuguese banking institution. The main objective of the analysis is predicting *whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit*. This classification task relies on various categorical features, such as the client’s education level, occupation, and marital status. Additionally, numerical features like the client’s age and average account balance are considered in the analysis.
